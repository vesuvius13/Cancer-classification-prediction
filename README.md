# Cancer-classification-prediction

Using the copy of UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets. https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2 , I created a prediction model which predicts on the basis of historical data whether the cancer cell is melignant or benign

Used Artificial Neural Networks to train the model (Keras API of TensorFlow 2.0)

Dataset:- cancer_classification.csv

Prediction code:- Keras_cancer_classification_code.ipynb
